## PATTERN MATCHING
### Reassigning Pattern Variables
	- possible
	- prevent by using final modifier
		
### Pattern Variables and Expression
#### Subtypes
	- Limitations of Subtype Enforcement
#### Flow Scoping
	- Means the variable is only in scope when the compiler can definitively determine its type
	- It is possible to use a pattern variable outside of the if statement, but only when the compiler can definitively determine its type.
